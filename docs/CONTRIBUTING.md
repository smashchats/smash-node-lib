## Getting started

### Creating a Radicle identity (DID)

We use [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), a decentralized network for code collaboration based on Git, to [manage our codebase and contributions](https://dev.smashchats.com/Radicle).

> Note that we also host [a GitHub mirror of this codebase](https://github.com/unstaticlabs/smash-node-lib).
> This means that you _may_ contribute to the codebase by opening Pull Requests (PRs) on the GitHub repository, but the code will be merged into the Radicle network first.
> We **strongly recommend** that regular contributors use Radicle & [working with patches](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#working-with-patches) to manage the codebase.

If you are new to Radicle, we recommend reading the [Radicle Getting Started Guide for Users](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user).

To [create a Radicle identity](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#come-into-being-from-the-elliptic-aether), run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh # installing radicle
rad auth # creating a new identity or logging in
```
