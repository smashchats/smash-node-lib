# Smash-Node-Lib

This ES Module library provides the core functionality for implementing and interacting with the **Smash Protocol**â€”a modular, **1:N social messaging** and **curated content-sharing** protocol.
It powers the free and open digital neighborhoods of tomorrow, promoting decentralization, interoperability, and user ownership.

## **Introduction**

The Smash Protocol enables secure, decentralized communication and content sharing without intermediaries. Smash-Node-Lib is an open-source library for building JavaScript-based clients, plugins, or microservices that interact with the protocol.

**Key Principles**:

- **Open Standards**: Fully modular and built on open APIs for interoperability.
- **Decentralization**: Peer-to-peer communication with no central authority.
- **User Ownership**: Your data, your rules.

For more details, see the full [documentation](./docs/README.md).

## **Features**

> Smash-Node-Lib is currently in the alpha stage of development.
> The Smash Protocol is not yet fully functional.

- **1:N Messaging**: Support for both one-on-one and group communications.
- **Neighborhood-Based Organization**: Join or create digital communities with unique rules and curation.
- **Modular Design**: Built as microservices for flexibility and extensibility.
- **Secure Communication**: Signal Protocol implementation ensures privacy.
- **Open APIs**: Integrate seamlessly with other applications or build your own clients.
- **AT Protocol**: Integrate with the AT Protocol for decentralized identity and social networking.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to start using the Smash-Node-Lib:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

Using Radicle:

> **WARNING**: The Smash-Node-Lib repository is currently private.
> You'll need to ask a maintainer to add you to the 'allow list'.
> Read more in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
rad clone rad:zZ6oTFp8JrVyhEQmrcfkQkQgmoQJ # RID for the Smash-Node-Lib repo
```

> You can find an updated list of all Smash's repository IDs (RIDs) on our [developer notes](https://dev.smashchats.com/radicle%20repos).

Using our GitHub mirror repository:

> **WARNING**: The Smash-Node-Lib repository is currently private.
> You'll need to ask a maintainer to grant you access to the repository.
> Read more in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smashchats/smash-node-lib.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:

- [Create a Radicle Identity](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#come-into-being-from-the-elliptic-aether).
- Connect to the Smash seeding node:

```bash
rad node connect z6MkiXzPZSV6yx6wHSdSPNpVVytxauiLzhU1jG8sVmxdZkcn@rad-node.smashchats.com:8778
```

> You can find a list of all Smash's seeding nodes on our [developer notes](https://dev.smashchats.com/radicle%20seeding%20node).

4. **Run All Test Suites**:

Looking at tests is a great way to understand how to use the library.
Tests have been written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and designed to provide a comprehensive set of examples on interacting with the `Smash-Node-Lib` library.

```bash
npm test
```

## **Usage**

> **WARNING**: The Smash-Node-Lib has not yet been published.
> The following examples are not yet fully functional.

**ATTENTION**: Have a look at our 'Smash Simple Neighborhood' repository for a working example of how to use the `Smash-Node-Lib` library in its current state.

### **Process unhandledRejections**

Handle errors gracefully in your application:

```typescript
const logger: Logger = ...;
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
    SmashMessaging.handleError(reason, promise, logger);
});
```

### **Processing messages**

1. The Smash messaging protocol might deliver messages out of order.
2. The Smash messaging protocol might deliver duplicate messages.

#### Deduplication

All messages bear a `message.sha256` hash.
This property is used to detect duplicates.
Already processed messages can safely be discarded if a duplicate is detected.

#### Re-ordering

Two properties of the message protocol ensure that messages can get re-ordered:

1. `message.timestamp`: sender's claimed timestamp of when the message was first queued.
2. `message.after`: the `sha256` hash of the message that this message depends on.

> If present, the `message.after` property is deemed trustable.
> Indeed, as it requires the sender to know the `sha256` hash of the previous message,
> this property can't be set to fake messages sent after a message that wasn't previously received by the sender.
> The sender could however always set this property to the `sha256` hash of a previously received message.
> This is impossible to enforce, but should not be harmful as long as clearly indicated.

Developers **should** always set `message.after` to the `sha256` hash of the previous message.
This ensures that messages can get re-ordered correctly.
When this value is unknown or ignored, the convention is to set it to the `0` value or to an empty string.

When the `message.after` property is unavailable, re-ordering is limited to the `message.timestamp` property.

#### Out of order messages

Messages received with inconsistent `timestamp` and `message.after` ordering should be **flagged** as suspicious.
Same for messages with a `timestamp` that is too far in the past, or, in the future (out of sync clocks).
